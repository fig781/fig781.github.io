My personal website is [https://aden-eilers.com](https://aden-eilers.com)

I am currently applying to webdev jobs. The goal of this site is to have a place where development managers can learn more about my development skills and experiences.

If you guys have any suggestions for things I should add, things I should change etc... that would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance for any feedback!
